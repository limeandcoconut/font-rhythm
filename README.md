# BOOST JS 🚀 Sample Project

Uses [boostjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/boostjs) and [boostjs-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/boostjs-server)

## Npm Scripts ##
* dev: Development mode. This will start the server and client build process.
* build-client: Build all front end code into minified, production ready bundle in /public/build
* production: Runs the server. This is subject to change (pm2)

## Notable Npm Modules
### Core:
  * Bluebird: promise library mostly being used for concise coroutines
  * jsonwebtoken: lightweight implementation of JWT checking and creation
  * thinky: RethinkDB ORM
  * socket.io: socket connections between server and client with multiplexing, fallbacks, auto-reconnect, and other useful features

### Dev:
  * webpack: Bundles markup, clientside scripts, and styles into all.min.js
  * babel: allows writing modern js with recompilation to work on older browsers
  * babel-preset-es2015/stage-3: allows using cutting edge JS features
  * hot module reloading: vue-hot-reload-api, vue-html-loader, vue-loader, webpack-dev-middleware, webpack-dev-server, and webpack-hot-middleware are all used to hot reload clientside code
  * nodemon: autoreloads serverside code on file changes
